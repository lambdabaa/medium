# A Solution by Gareth Aye

___Problem statement:___  
Given a random matrix, where each cell is either 1 or 0, determine the groups 
of contiguous cells that have the value 1.  Cells are considered contiguous  
if they are neighboring to the north, south, east, or west; i.e. no  
diagonals.  
  
___Expected deliverable:___  
The solution can be coded in any language or environment, but preferably  
something we can run easily on our macs :)  The result does not necessarily  
need to be visual, for example, you could just write to stdout.
